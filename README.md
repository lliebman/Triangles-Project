This program was an assignment of mine last year. The prompt was as follows:

/**
 * Triangle class    
 * Design and implement a Triangle class containing three instances of a Point object.  
 * 
 * In addition to the usual standard methods, Triangle class should have a method to:
 * 1.   calculate the area, 
 * 2.   calculate perimeter (sum of the sides), 
 * 3.   check that the three points actually form a triangle, 
 * i.e., that they are not collinearImplement a TriangleExerciser class containing main 
 * should read three points from a file and calculate the area and the perimeter of the triangle. 
 *
 */
 /**
 *  * Point class should have:
 * 1.   two private double members xCoordinate and yCoordinate  
 * 2.   the usual constructor(s)
 * 3.   the usual getters and setters
 * 4. toString and equals methods
 * 5. distanceTo method with the signature: public double distanceTo(Point other)
 * squr((x2−x1)2+(y2−y1))
 */
 /**
 * It should report an error whenever the three specified points do not form a triangle.
 */
